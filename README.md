transformers
============

A portable library of functor and monad transformers from
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers
, originally inspired by the paper

  *  "Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order Polymorphism",
     by Mark P Jones, in Advanced School of Functional Programming, 1995
     (http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html).

This package contains:

  *  the monad transformer class (in Control.Monad.Trans.Class)

  *  concrete functor and monad transformers, each with associated operations and functions to lift operations associated with other transformers.
